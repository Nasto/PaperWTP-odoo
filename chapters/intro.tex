% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:

% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....

% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....

% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{V}{ariability} management is an essential part of working on product lines. There are several approaches trying to control the vast amount of product variants though configuration. This allows experts to apply their domain knowledge in order to a resulting product conforming to a users needs.

Feature Models are vital tools for the configuration of product lines in such a way that they give a complete and easily understandable overview of the given features and constraints of a product-line. This work aims at automatically generating feature models out of descriptive files and naming conventions, to simplify a big part of the configuration.

This paper considers existing methods of configuration and tries to come up with a better alternative based on questionnaires to enable users or customers to configure a product on their own and to allow experts to design the questionnaires according to their domain knowledge.

\section*{Problem statement}
Very high complexity of configuration due to many features and constraints. Domain knowledge is highly required to understand the given software product-line and being able to combine it's features to a valid configuration which satisfies the users needs.

\section*{Contribution}

Simplifying the process of configuration of product lines through extracting a feature model out of naming conventions and configuration files from an existing product line in FeatureIDE and applying a configuration wizard which guides the user though the creation of a specific product (variant) in the style of a questionnaire, thus applying the domain knowledge of an expert.
