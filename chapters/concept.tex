unstructured product line $\rightarrow$ generated feature model $\rightarrow$ optimizing (via SAT-solver?) $\rightarrow$ domain knowledge of an expert $\Rightarrow$ Questionnaire $\rightarrow$ Feature model + Questionnaire $\Rightarrow$ Product (variant)


\subsection{Extraction of a feature model}
The (Naming-)conventions and rules that are applied to generate a feature model out of it.\\
State the problems? Error-Handling on failure to comply the conventions?

\subsection{Questionnaire Approach}
Use questions to guide the user through a conditional configuration process. The questions, their order and the influences of the answers are pre-defined by a developer/an expert who uses his domain knowledge to design the questionnaire. Therefore, a data structure is introduced and mapped to a specific set of XML-tags.
