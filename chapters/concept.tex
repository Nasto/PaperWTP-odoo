unstructured product line $\rightarrow$ generated feature model $\rightarrow$ optimizing (via SAT-solver?) $\rightarrow$ domain knowledge of an expert $\Rightarrow$ Questionnaire $\rightarrow$ Feature model + Questionnaire $\Rightarrow$ Product (variant)


\subsection{Extraction of a feature model}
Describe the conventions and which rules are applied to generate a feature model out of it.

\subsection{Questionnaire Approach}
Use benefits of the existing approaches and overcome their shortcomings to solve the problem. State different variants and show the best one through comparison.
