\subsection{Feature Models}
Multi-purpose tool for product lines:
\begin{itemize}
\item Visualization of the possible features and their hierarchy
\item Classification of features and their dependencies (alternative/or; optional/mandatory/abstract)
\item Formal Representation of the whole product line $\Rightarrow$ computationally processable
\item assistance/foundation for configuration and variant validation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Product configuration}
Customizing a product line to specific needs, resulting in a product/variant\\
Simplified to a list of (un-)selected features contained in the resulting product/variant\\

\subsection{Constraints, contradictions, SAT-solver}
Rules \& constraints specify (in-)valid configurations $\Rightarrow$ formalism of feature models allows SAT-solvers to check for validity\\
Already possible after each step of the ongoing configuration to check partial configurations
